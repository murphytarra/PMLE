    "- **File name**: The name of the file to open.\n",
    "- **Mode**: Specifies the mode in which the file is opened (read, write, append, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open(filename, mode)\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a `with` block is the recommended way to handle files as it automatically closes the file after use:\n",
