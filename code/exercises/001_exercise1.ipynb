    "# Let's Build an Awesome Machine Learning Library with MNIST! üéâ\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's the Plan?\n",
    "Imagine you're creating your very own Python library that can handle everything related to the MNIST dataset. From loading and processing data to training machine learning models‚Äîyour library will be the one-stop-shop for all things MNIST! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®\n",
    "\n",
    "And here's the twist: this is going to be used later on in the week, so it's super important you do this right! You're going to flex everything you've learned‚Äîdata types, functions, advanced Python, OOP, file handling, and even some error handling magic‚Äîto make it truly robust and professional. Plus, it should be so reusable that others could use it for their projects in the future. Cool, right? üöÄ\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Will Your Class Do?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Handle the MNIST Dataset Like a Pro**\n",
    "- **Load It**: From a file or even download it online if needed.\n",
    "- **Save It**: After preprocessing, save the clean data so you don‚Äôt have to redo it every time.\n",
    "- **Handle Errors**: If a file is missing or corrupted, your library will handle it gracefully and let users know.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Get That Data Ready for Action**\n",
    "- Normalize pixel values to `[0, 1]` so your models train better.\n",
    "- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets like a data scientist would.\n",
    "- Add some fun utilities, like:\n",
    "  - **Data Augmentation**: Flip, rotate, or shuffle the images to make them more diverse.\n",
    "  - **Visualization**: Show a few digits to see what you're working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Be the Architect with OOP üèõ**\n",
    "- **`Dataset` Class**: Manage the dataset‚Äîloading, saving, splitting, and even showing off samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Show Off Your Advanced Python Skills**\n",
    "- Create **decorators** like:\n",
    "  - `@timing` to measure how long things take. ‚è±Ô∏è\n",
    "  - `@log_errors` to automatically catch and log any issues. üõ†Ô∏è\n",
    "- Use **closures** to create handy tools, like data augmentation functions with adjustable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Keep It Bulletproof with Error Handling**\n",
    "- Missing files? Corrupted data? Your library won't crash‚Äîit'll handle it smoothly and log the errors like a professional. üõ°Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Save It, Share It, Use It**\n",
    "- Save models and datasets using file handling, so you (and your users) can pick up right where you left off.\n",
    "- Create log files to keep track of training progress and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Will It Work? Here's a Sneak Peek:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "# Load the dataset\n",
    "dataset = Dataset()\n",
    "dataset.load_from_file(\"mnist_data.csv\")\n",
